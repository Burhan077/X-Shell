-----------------
THE X SHELL (xsh) 
-----------------

Version
-----------------
To install, Run the Following 

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/xsh
  make
  make install

This is just zsh with a different name so please use the official zsh and not this.
This is just a fun experiment meant for learning how Basic Shells work

-Installing xsh
-Trust me and just do this in your Terminal:

        sed -i 's/^bin_PROGRAMS = zsh$/bin_PROGRAMS = xsh/' Src/Makefile.in
        sed -i 's/^zsh_SOURCES = /xsh_SOURCES = /' Src/Makefile.in
        sed -i 's/^zsh_LDADD = /xsh_LDADD = /' Src/Makefile.in

For good measure:

      sed -i 's/AC_INIT(zsh/AC_INIT(xsh/' configure.ac


The Compiled stuff will be at /usr/bin/zsh-5.9.0.2-test or something. 
Don't just run this chack where the actual binary is. 

      sudo mv /usr/bin/zsh-5.9.0.2-test  /usr/bin/xsh
      sudo echo "/usr/bin/xsh" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
      chsh -s /usr/bin/xsh
    
For Powerlevel10K users you can create a .zshrc and paste this in

      source ~/.xshrc

This is all to rename your Shell, so I have to say its totally not worth it.
--------------

The instructions for compiling xsh are in the file INSTALL.  You should
also check the file MACHINES in the top directory to see if there
are any special instructions for your particular architecture.

Note in particular the xsh/newuser module that guides new users through
setting basic shell options without the administrator's intervention.  This
is turned on by default.  See the section AUTOMATIC NEW USER CONFIGURATION
in INSTALL for configuration information.

Features
--------

xsh is a shell with lots of features.  For a list of some of these, see the
file FEATURES, and for the latest changes see NEWS.  For more
details, see the documentation.


Again, this is all to give your shell a cool name, so I have to say its totally not worth it.
If you want other names be sure to replace the instances of xsh with the name you prefer.
All credit goes to the people who actually build this amazing thing. Their names are listed in Etc/contributors.
For any issues please just use zsh as there is no difference.
